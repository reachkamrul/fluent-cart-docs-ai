# Downloads

The **Downloads** section of your FluentCart Customer Profile provides a centralized place to access all digital products you have purchased. This includes software, e-books, templates, and any other downloadable content.

## Accessing Your Digital Products

Upon navigating to the Downloads page, you will see a list of all downloadable products available to you. Each entry typically includes:

* **Product Name**: The name of the digital product (e.g., "Sticky Note").
* **File Name**: The name of the downloadable file (e.g., `sticky-note.zip`).
* **File Size**: The size of the downloadable file (e.g., "2.16 MB").
* **Action**: A "Download" button to initiate the file download.

You can navigate through pages if you have many downloads (e.g., "Page 1 of 1", "10/page Total 1").

Simply click the **Download** button next to the product you wish to obtain, and the file will begin downloading to your device.
