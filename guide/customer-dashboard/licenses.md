# Licenses

The **Licenses** section of your FluentCart Customer Profile is where you can view and manage all your purchased software licenses. This is particularly useful for digital products like plugins or themes that require activation.

## Viewing All Licenses

The main Licenses page presents a list of all your available licenses. Each license entry typically includes:

* **Product Name**: The product associated with the license (e.g., "Sticky Note").
* **Plan Name**: The specific plan or tier of the license (e.g., "Sticky Note Lifetime").
* **Status**: The current status of the license (e.g., "Active").
* **Expiration Date**: When the license is set to expire (e.g., "Expires on: May 30, 2026").
* **License Key**: The unique key for your product (e.g., `SNW-.......... f1bc1`).

You can navigate through pages if you have many licenses (e.g., "Page 1 of 1", "10/page Total 1").
