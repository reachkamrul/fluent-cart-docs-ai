# Profile Management

The **Profile** section of your FluentCart Customer Dashboard allows you to view and update your personal information, billing addresses, and shipping addresses. Keeping this information up-to-date ensures accurate billing and smooth delivery of physical products.

Upon navigating to the **Profile** tab from the main dashboard menu (which includes sections like Dashboard, Purchase History, Subscriptions, Licenses, and Downloads), you will see your customer profile details.

## Account Details

This subsection, clearly labeled "Account Details", displays your basic account information:

* **First Name:** Your first name, for example, "Nash".
* **Last Name:** Your last name, for example, "Cleveland".
* **Email:** Your registered email address.

## Billing Address

This section allows you to provide or update the address where your billing statements and invoices will be sent.

* **Add New Address:** Click the **+ ADD NEW ADDRESS** button to add a new billing address.
* **Default Address:** You can view your saved billing addresses. To modify an existing default shipping address, use the **three-dot** button to find the **Edit** option. A pop-up will then guide you through updating the address fields, click on **Update Address** button to update the address or **Cancel** to cancel editing.

## Shipping Address

This section allows you to provide or update the address where your orders will be delivered.

* **Add New Address:** Click the **+ ADD NEW ADDRESS** button to add a new shipping address.
* **Default Address:** You can view your saved shipping addresses. If you want to modify an existing default shipping address, use the **three-dot** button to access the **Edit** option. 

Always remember to click **SAVE PROFILE** at the bottom of the page after making any changes to your account details or addresses to ensure your updates are saved.
