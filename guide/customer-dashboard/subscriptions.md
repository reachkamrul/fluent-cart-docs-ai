# Subscriptions

The **Subscriptions** section allows you to view and manage all your recurring product subscriptions. This is where you can see the status of your active and canceled plans, renewal dates, and payment methods.

## Viewing All Subscriptions

The main subscriptions page displays a list of all your subscriptions, including:

* **Product Name**: The name of the subscribed product (e.g., "Sticky Note").
* **Payment Method**: Often masked for security (e.g., "**** 4242").
* **Status**: The current status of the subscription (e.g., "Active", "Canceled").
* **Renewal Date**: When the subscription is set to auto-renew (e.g., "Auto renews on May 23, 2026").
* **Billing Cycle**: The recurring cost and frequency (e.g., "$89.00 per year, until cancel.").

You can navigate through pages if you have multiple subscriptions (e.g., "Page 1 of 1", "10/page Total 3").
