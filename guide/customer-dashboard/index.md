# Customer Dashboard

The FluentCart Customer Dashboard serves as a comprehensive and personalized portal for every customer, offering a centralized location to manage all aspects of their interactions with your e-commerce store. This powerful dashboard empowers customers to efficiently handle their orders, subscriptions, licenses, and personal details.

Ensure you have set the Customer Dashboard page from **FluentCart Pro** > **Settings** > **Pages Setup**, and your users can access their dashboard on that particular page. For detailed instructions on setting this up, please refer to our [Pages Setup documentation](/guide/settings-configuration/pages-setup).

## Key Sections of the Customer Dashboard

Initially, you will see a quick summary of Purchases, Subscriptions, Licenses, and Downloads. Beyond this, the dashboard is intuitively organized into several distinct sections to ensure customers can easily navigate and manage their information:

* **[Purchase History (Orders & Payment Details)](/guide/customer-dashboard/purchase-history)**: Provides a complete and detailed record of all past orders, including transaction details, payment statuses, and options to download invoices.
* **[Managing Subscriptions](/guide/customer-dashboard/subscriptions)**: Allows customers to view and control their recurring product subscriptions, offering options to check status, renewal dates, and manage associated details.
* **[Managing Licenses](/guide/customer-dashboard/licenses)**: A dedicated area for accessing and managing all purchased software licenses, including viewing license keys, activation limits, and renewal information.
* **[Digital Product Downloads](/guide/customer-dashboard/downloads)**: Enables customers to easily find and download all digital products they have purchased.
* **[Profile & Address Settings](/guide/customer-dashboard/profile-settings)**: Where customers can update their personal contact information, manage billing addresses, and shipping addresses for future orders.

This comprehensive structure ensures that customers have all the necessary tools at their fingertips for a seamless and efficient experience with your FluentCart store.
