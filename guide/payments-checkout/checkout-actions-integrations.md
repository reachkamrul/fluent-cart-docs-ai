 # Checkout Actions & Integrations

The **Checkout Actions** screen in FluentCart is designed to manage and configure integrations that directly influence or enhance the customer's checkout experience. This allows you to extend the functionality of your checkout process through various modules and third-party services.

## Accessing Checkout Actions

1.  From your WordPress dashboard, navigate to **FluentCart Pro > Settings** in the left sidebar.
2.  Click on the **"Checkout Actions"** tab.

## Understanding Checkout Actions

This screen serves as a dashboard for integrations that are relevant to the checkout flow.

* **Integration Status Message:** If you haven't enabled any relevant integration modules, you'll see a message like "You don't have any integration module enabled."
* **Guidance for Enabling Modules:** The screen provides clear instructions: "Please go to integration modules and enable and configured from available modules."
* **"Configure Modules" Button:** This button acts as a shortcut, likely directing you to the main [Integrations](/guide/settings-configuration/email-notifications/) section where you can enable new modules.
* **"Check Global Integration Settings" Link:** This link suggests there are overarching settings that might impact how integrations function across your store.
* **"View Documentations" Link:** Provides quick access to relevant documentation for integrations.
* **Conditional Display of Integrations:** Once you have enabled and configured specific integration modules that interact with the checkout process, they will be listed on this screen for further management or configuration. The message "if I have any integration setup, they will show here" indicates this dynamic display.

## Common Use Cases for Checkout Actions

Integrations configurable here can help with:

* **Marketing Automations:** Adding customers to an email list upon successful checkout.
* **Analytics:** Sending checkout data to external analytics platforms.
* **CRM Integration:** Updating customer profiles in your CRM system post-purchase.
* **Payment Gateways:** While primary payment gateway setup is under [Payment Settings](/guide/payments-checkout/connecting-payment-gateways/), specific checkout-related enhancements might be managed here.
