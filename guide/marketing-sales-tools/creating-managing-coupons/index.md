## Understanding the Coupons List Table

The Coupons list table provides key information for each coupon at a glance:

* **ID:** The unique identification number for the coupon.
* **Title:** The internal name given to the coupon.
* **Code:** The actual code that customers will enter at checkout to receive the discount.
* **Amount:** The value of the discount.
* **Usage:** Shows how many times the coupon has been used versus its total limit.
* **Stackable:** Indicates if the coupon can be combined with other discounts.
* **Status:** : Here shows if the Coupon is active or inactive.
* **Expiry Date:** The date when the coupon expires.
* **Actions:** Click the three vertical dots for action options. From here, you can delete or edit coupons.

## Filtering Coupons

You can quickly filter your coupons based on their status:

* **All:** Displays all coupons, regardless of their status.
* **Active:** Shows only coupons that are currently enabled and usable.
* **Inactive:** Displays coupons that are expired, disabled, or not yet active.

## Creating New Coupons

FluentCart allows you to create two main types of coupons: **Fixed Amount** and **Percentage.**

* **Adding Fixed Type Coupons:** For discounts that deduct a specific monetary amount (e.g., $10 off).
* **Adding Percentage Type Coupons:** For discounts that deduct a percentage of the total order or specific items (e.g., 20% off).
