# Adding Coupons

This section will guide you through the process of adding a new coupon in FluentCart, allowing you to choose between different types of discounts to best suit your promotional campaigns.

## Types of Coupons Available

When creating a new coupon in FluentCart, you have the flexibility to choose between two main types of discounts:

* **Fixed Amount Coupons:** These coupons deduct a specific monetary value (e.g., $10 off) from the total order or eligible items.
* **Percentage Type Coupons:** These coupons apply a percentage-based discount (e.g., 20% off) to the total order or specific items. 

You can select the type that best suits your promotional needs.

## Steps to Add a New Coupon

1.  From your WordPress dashboard, navigate to **FluentCart Pro > Coupons** in the left sidebar.
2.  On the **Coupons** screen, click the **"Add Coupon"** button at the top right.

### 1. Basic Information

* **Title:** Enter an internal title for your coupon (e.g., "Holiday Sale Discount"). This is for your reference and not visible to customers.
* **Code:** This is the actual discount code that customers will enter at checkout (e.g., "HOLIDAY10"). You can type a custom code or click **"Generate Random Code"** to create one automatically.
* **Coupon Priority:** (Optional) Enter a numerical value to set the priority of this coupon. A higher number might indicate a higher priority if multiple coupons can be applied.

### 2. Discount Value (Fixed Type)

* **Type:** Select **"Fixed"** from the dropdown menu.
* **Discount Amount\*:** Enter the specific monetary value of the discount (e.g., "10.00" for $10 off).
* **Min Purchase Amount:** (Optional) Enter a minimum subtotal amount that the customer's cart must meet for the coupon to be valid. Default is $0.

### 3. Discount Value (Percentage Type)

* **Type:** Select **"Percentage"** from the dropdown menu.
* **Discount Percentage (%)\***: Enter the percentage value of the discount (e.g., "20" for 20% off).
* **Min Purchase Amount:** (Optional) Enter a minimum subtotal amount that the customer's cart must meet for the coupon to be valid. Default is $0.
* **Max Discount Amount:** (Optional) Enter a maximum monetary value for the discount. This is useful for percentage coupons to prevent excessively large discounts on very high-value orders. Default is $0 (no maximum).

### 5. Schedule

Define when the coupon becomes active and when it expires.

* **Start Date & Time:** Set the date and time when the coupon becomes valid.
* **Set end date & time:** Check this box to enable an end date, then set the date and time when the coupon will expire.

### 6. Maximum Discount Uses

Control how many times the coupon can be used.

* **Total Limit:** Enter the maximum number of times this coupon can be used across all customers. Enter "0" for unlimited usage.
* **Per User Limit:** Enter the maximum number of times a single customer can use this coupon. Enter "0" for unlimited usage per user.

### 7. Additional Information
