 # Viewing & Searching Customers

The Customers list in FluentCart provides an organized overview of all individuals who have interacted with your store. This guide will show you how to navigate this list and effectively use search and filtering options to find specific customer profiles.

## Accessing the Customers List

1.  From your WordPress dashboard, navigate to **FluentCart Pro > Customers** in the left sidebar.
2.  This will open the main **Customers** screen, displaying a table of all your registered customers.

## Understanding the Customers List Table

The Customers list table presents key information for each customer at a glance:

* **Customer:** Displays the customer's name and their associated email address. 
* **Address:** Shows a summarized address for the customer. 
* **Purchase Count:** Indicates the total number of orders or purchases made by that customer. 
* **Last Purchase Date:** Shows the date and time of their most recent purchase. 
* **Customer Since:** Displays the date and time when the customer's record was first created in your system.

## Pagination

At the bottom of the customer list, you'll find pagination controls that allow you to navigate through larger customer databases.

* **Page 1 of X:** Shows your current page out of the total number of pages. 
* **X/page:** Allows you to select how many customer records are displayed per page (e.g., "10/page"). 
* **Total Y:** Indicates the total number of customers in your store (e.g., "Total 2").
