 # Using Advanced Customer Filters

FluentCart's **Advanced Filter** tool on the Customers screen allows you sort your customers into groups and quickly find exact groups of customers by using very specific rules. This is super useful for sending special ads to certain groups, understanding your customers, or doing certain office jobs.

## Accessing and Using the Advanced Filter

1.  From your WordPress dashboard, navigate to **FluentCart Pro > Customers**.
2.  On the **Customers** screen, enable the **"Advanced Filter"** by clicking the **"toggle"** button in the top right corner. The Advanced Filter section will expand, allowing you to define your filtering criteria.

## Defining Filter Criteria

The Advanced Filter enables you to combine various properties to create precise customer segments.

* **Order Property:** This allows you to filter customers based on aspects of their orders.
    * **Purchase Count:** Filter customers by the number of purchases they have made (e.g., customers with more than 5 purchases, or exactly 1 purchase).
    * **First Purchase Date:** Filter customers based on the date of their very first order. This is useful for identifying new customer cohorts or specific periods of acquisition.
    * **Last Purchase Date:** Filter customers based on the date of their most recent order. This is helpful for identifying recent buyers or customers who haven't purchased in a while.

* **Adding Multiple Conditions:**
    * Click **"+ Add"** to add another rule for filtering. This typically functions as an "AND" condition, meaning all criteria must be met.
    * Click the **"+ OR"** button to add an alternative filter condition. This allows you to find customers who meet *either* the previous set of criteria *or* the new one.

## Applying and Resetting Filters

1.  After setting your desired filter conditions, click the **"Apply"** button to view the filtered list of customers.
2.  To clear all applied filters and view the complete customer list again, click the **"Reset"** button.

Using the Advanced Filter effectively allows you to gain deeper insights into your customer base and perform more targeted customer management.
