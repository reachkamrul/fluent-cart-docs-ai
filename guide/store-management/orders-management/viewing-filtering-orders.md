 # Viewing & Filtering Orders

The Orders list is your central hub for tracking all transactions and customer purchases in your FluentCart store. This guide explains how to effectively view your order list and use the available filters to quickly find specific orders.

## Understanding Order Stats Overview

Beyond the main list, you can get a quick summary of your order stats.
To see this overview, click on **More Actions** button in the top right corner of the Orders screen, and then select "**Show Order Stats**". You can hide this overview anytime by using the same option again.

This section provides a snapshot of important order numbers, including:

* **All orders:** The total count of all orders in your store. 
* **Paid Orders:** The number of orders that have been successfully paid for.
* **Paid Order items:** The total count of individual product items across all paid orders.
* **Order value (Paid):** The total monetary value of all paid orders.

## Understanding the Orders List Table

The Orders list is presented in a table format, with each row representing an individual order and displaying key information at a glance:

* **Date:** The date and time when the order was placed.
* **Customer:** The name of the customer who placed the order.
* **Items:** The number of distinct product items included in the order.
* **Total:** The total monetary value of the order.

* **Order Type:** Differentiates between various types of transactions.
* **Action Icons:** On the far right of each row, you'll see icons that let you quickly print things like order details.

## Filtering Orders

FluentCart provides many ways to filter your orders, helping you narrow down the list based on status or other criteria.

### 1. Filtering by Order Status

At the top of the Orders list, you'll find tabs that allow you to quickly filter orders by their main status:

* **All:** Displays all orders regardless of their status.
* **Completed:** Shows orders that have been successfully fulfilled and paid.
* **Processing:** Displays orders that are currently being prepared or shipped.
* **On Hold:** Shows orders that are awaiting payment or other administrative action.
* **Paid:** Filters the list to show only orders for which payment has been received.
