2.  On the **Orders** screen, locate and click the **"Create Order"** button in the top right corner.

    * **Customer Information:** Choose an existing customer from your store or you may create new.
    * **Products:** Search for and add the products the customer is purchasing.
        * You can select product variants if applicable.
        * Specify the quantity for each product.
    * **Have a Coupon:** If a discount coupon applies to this manual order, you can enter and apply it here.
    * **Add Discount:** If you want to add a discount for the order, click the Add Discount option.
    * **Add Shipping Cost:** Manually you can add shipping charges for physical products.
    * **Review Totals:** Ensure the order subtotal and total amount are correct after adding products and any discounts/shipping.
    * **Notes:** Click the **Notes** icon to add any private notes or comments relevant to the order.
    * **Labels:**  A section for assigning custom labels.

4.  **Choose Payment Method:** Select the payment method for this order. This might include:
    * Marking the order as "Paid" if payment was received offline (e.g., cash, bank transfer).
    * Generating a custom payment link to send to the customer for online payment.
    * Processing payment directly if you have integrated payment gateways.

5.  **Finalize Order:** Once all details are correct and the payment method is selected, click the **Save** button finalize the order.
