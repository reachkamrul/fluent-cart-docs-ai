# Roles & Permissions

The **Roles & Permissions** feature in FluentCart allows you to define and manage different user roles within your store's backend. This helps control who can access certain features and perform specific actions, ensuring security and proper task delegation among your team.

## Accessing Roles & Permissions

1.  From your WordPress dashboard, navigate to **FluentCart Pro > Settings** in the left sidebar.
2.  Click on the **"Roles And Permissions"** tab.

## Understanding Roles and Permissions

Here displays a list of users and their assigned FluentCart roles.

### 1. Roles List Table

The table provides an overview of existing role assignments:

* **User:** Displays the user's name and email address.
* **Role Title:** The name of the FluentCart role assigned to the user.
* **Roles:** A brief description of the permissions granted by that role.
* **Action Icons:** On the far right of each row, you'll see icons that let you quickly "edit" or "delete" roles & permission details.

### 2. Adding New Roles

You can assign existing WordPress users to predefined FluentCart roles directly from this display. 

* Click the **"+ Add Role"** button at the top right of the screen. This will open a modal to [add a new role](/settings-configuration/roles-permissions/adding-new-roles/index).

By effectively managing roles and permissions, you can ensure that each team member has the appropriate level of access to your FluentCart store.
