## Configuring Your Store Details

    * Click the "Remove" button if you wish to remove an existing logo.

### 2. Order Mode

Select your storeâ€™s order mode from the dropdown. There are two options: **Test** and **Live**. Use "Test Mode" while setting up your store. Switch to "Live Mode" when you're ready to start accepting real orders.

### 2. Address

Provide your physical business address details. This information can be used for shipping calculations, tax purposes, and displayed in various store documents.
