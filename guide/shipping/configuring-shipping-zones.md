# Configuring Shipping Zones in FluentCart

Shipping zones are geographical regions that allow you to define specific shipping methods and rates for your customers. By creating zones, you can customize shipping options for different countries or areas. This guide will walk you through setting up a new shipping zone.

## How to Add and Manage Shipping Zones

1.  **Navigate to Shipping Settings**:
    To begin, you must navigate to the shipping configuration area within FluentCart.

    * From the main WordPress dashboard, locate the **FluentCart Pro** section in the left-hand navigation menu and click on **Settings**.
    * On the Settings page, select the **Shipping** tab.
    * Ensure the **Shipping Zones** sub-tab is selected. This screen will display all of your existing shipping zones.


2.  **Add a New Shipping Zone**:
    * Click the **"Add Shipping Zone"** button.
    * You will be taken to the "Add Shipping Zone" detail page.

3.  **Define Zone Details**:
    * **Zone Name**: Enter a descriptive name for your shipping zone (e.g., "Domestic - USA", "European Union", "Local Delivery Area"). This name will help you identify the zone in your settings.
    * **Regions**: Select the specific countries that belong to this zone. You can start typing to search for countries and select them from the dropdown.

4.  **Save the Shipping Zone**:
    * Once you have entered all the necessary details, click the **"Save Shipping Zone"** button.

Your new shipping zone will now appear in the list of zones, and you can proceed to add [shipping methods](/guide/shipping/setting-up-shipping-methods.md) to it.

**Important Considerations**:
* Customers will only see shipping methods applicable to the zone their shipping address falls into.
<!-- * FluentCart processes zones from top to bottom (most specific to least specific). If a customer's address matches multiple zones, the most specific one will apply. -->
