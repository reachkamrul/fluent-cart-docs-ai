# Creating & Managing Product Types

In FluentCart, Product Types are a flexible way to classify and group your products. This feature allows you to create your own unique system for organizing items in a way that best suits your business needs.

Think of a "Type" as a custom label. For example, you could create types like "Plugins," to help you manage and filter your inventory more effectively.

Using Product Types helps you sort and handle different collections of products based on your own specific requirements.

## Accessing Product Types

1.  From your WordPress dashboard, navigate to **FluentCart Pro > Product Types** in the left WordPress sidebar.
2.  This will open the **Types** screen, displaying a table of all your existing product types.

## Understanding the Product Types List Table

The Product Types list table provides key information for each defined type:

* **Name:** The descriptive name of the product type (e.g., "Plugins").
* **Description:** A brief explanation of what this product type represents.
* **Slug:** The URL-friendly version of the type name, automatically generated but editable.
* **Count:** The number of products currently assigned to that specific product type.

## Creating a New Product Type

1.  On the **Types** screen, click the **"Add New Type"** button at the top right.

2.  An **"Add New Type"** modal window will appear.

    

3.  Fill in the following details for your new product type:
    * **Name:** Enter the desired name for your product type (e.g., "Software"). This field is required.
    * **Slug:** (Optional) Enter a URL-friendly version of the name. If left blank, FluentCart will automatically generate one from the name.
    * **Parent Type:** Use the dropdown labeled "Select" to choose an existing product type if you want this new type to be a sub-type (e.g., a "Premium Software" type under a "Software" parent type). If it's a top-level type, leave this as "Select".
    * **Description:** Provide a brief description of what this product type represents or its primary characteristics.

4.  Click the **"Add New Type"** button within the modal to save your new product type.
5.  To cancel, click the **"Cancel"** button.

## Searching and Filtering Product Types

* **Search Bar:** Use the search bar at the top of the Types list to "Search by name & hit enter." to quickly find specific product types.
* **Sorting:** You can sort the list by clicking the up/down arrows next to the column headers. 
* **Edit & Delete:** To edit or delete a category, click the three-dot menu next to the category name. From there, select Edit or Delete based on your need.
