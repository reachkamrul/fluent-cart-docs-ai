# Creating & Managing Product Categories

In FluentCart, product categories help you group similar items together. This makes it easier for customers to browse your store and find what they are looking for.

For example, you can create categories like "Men's Clothing," to organize your products effectively. Well-organized categories can improve the shopping experience and help increase sales.

## Accessing Product Categories

1.  From your WordPress dashboard, navigate to **FluentCart Pro > Product Categories** in the left WordPress sidebar.
2.  This will open the **Categories** screen, displaying a table of all your existing product categories.

## Understanding the Categories List Table

The Categories list table provides key information for each category:

* **Name:** The descriptive name of the product category (e.g., "Software", "Mens Shoes").
* **Description:** A brief description of the category.
* **Slug:** The URL-friendly version of the category name, automatically generated but editable.
* **Count:** The number of products currently assigned to that specific category.

## Creating a New Product Category

1.  On the **Categories** screen, click the **"Add New Category"** button at the top right.

2.  An **"Add New Category"** modal window will appear.

   

3.  Fill in the following details for your new category:
    * **Name:** Enter the desired name for your category (e.g., "E-Books", "Women's Apparel"). This field is required.
    * **Slug:** (Optional) Enter a URL-friendly version of the name. If left blank, FluentCart will automatically generate one from the name.
    * **Parent Category:** Use the dropdown labeled "Select" to choose an existing category if you want this new category to be a sub-category. If it's a top-level category, leave this as "Select".
    * **Description:** Provide a brief description of what products this category will contain.

4.  Click the **"Add New Category"** button within the modal to save your new category.
5.  To cancel, click the **"Cancel"** button.

* **Sorting:** You can sort the list by clicking the up/down arrows next to the column headers. 
* **Edit & Delete:** To edit or delete a category, click the three-dot menu next to the category name. From there, select either Edit or Delete based on your need.
