 # Managing Product Integrations (Product-Specific)

FluentCart allows you to connect individual products with relevant external services or FluentCart modules. This provides a flexible way to extend your product's functionality, streamline workflows, or integrate with third-party platforms directly from the product level.

## Accessing Product-Specific Integrations

Product-specific integration settings are found within the **Edit Product** screen for individual products.

1.  Navigate to **FluentCart Pro > Products** in your WordPress dashboard.
2.  [Edit an existing product](/guide/product-types-creation/product-list-overview) by clicking its name or the "Edit" action.
3.  On the **Edit Product** screen, click on the **"Integrations"** tab.

## Configuring Product Integrations

This section will display available integrations that can be connected specifically to this product. The options here will depend on which FluentCart modules or compatible third-party integrations you have [enabled globally](/guide/settings-configuration/email-notifications/).

* **Available Integrations:** You will see a list of modules that can interact with this product (e.g., FluentCRM, FluentForms).
    * **FluentCRM:** If connected, you might configure actions like adding customers who purchase this product to a specific CRM list or tagging them.
    * **FluentForms:** If connected, you might set up actions related to form submissions upon product purchase.
* **Connect/Manage Button:** Next to each integration, there will be a button (e.g., "Connect with FluentCRM", "Connect with FluentForms") to initiate or manage the connection.
* **"Add Integration" Button:** Allows you to add new integration instances if multiple configurations are needed for a single module.
* **"More Actions" Dropdown:** May provide additional options for managing integrations (e.g., refreshing integration status).

## Purpose of Product-Specific Integrations

Product-level integrations are useful for:

* **Targeted Marketing:** Automatically enrolling customers who buy a specific product into a relevant email sequence in your CRM.
* **Course Enrollment:** Granting access to a specific online course upon the purchase of an associated digital product.
* **Automated Workflows:** Triggering custom actions in other tools based on a product's purchase or status.
